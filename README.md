# [DEPRECATED] SOCAL MIST WEBSITE
As of 2/24/25, the website's source has been moved [here](https://github.com/YKawesome/SoCal-Mist-Website). 

This decision was made due to the significant overhead of older frameworks and messy code/organization.

We have moved to a solution using React + Vite + TailwindCSS + DaisyUI, with GitHub Pages for deployment.
